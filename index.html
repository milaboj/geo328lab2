        <h1>What Is Mead?</h1>
        <p>Mead or honey wine is a honey based alcoholic beverage which can have 
            an alcohol content ranging from 6-20% alcohol by volume (ABV). 
            It is simple to brew at home because the process can be completed 
            at home with minimal equipment it requires only  
            water, honey, and yeast and the fermentation.</p>

        <h2>What are Yeasts?</h2>

        Yeast are microscopic organisms (fungi) that convert 
        sugars into alcohol and CO2 in a process called fermentation. 
        They consume sugars, producing alcohol and CO2 as their waste 
        products. Different types of yeasts have different alcohol 
        tolerances meaning that after a certain alcohol by volume (ABV) 
        is reached the yeast can no longer produce more alcohol in that 
        environment even if there are more fermentable sugars present. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Wine and brewing yeast strains tend to have higher alcohol 
        tolerances so if you decide to use a bread yeast your mead might 
        not reach as high of an ABV. There is a lot of variability among 
        yeast of even the same species so individual packets will be 
        different and you may get very different results in terms of ABV 
        and flavor with the same yeast strain and recipe. When not using 
        your yeast it should be stored in the fridge or freezer to last longer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Honey does not provide all the necessary nutrients for yeast such as 
        nitrogen so yeast nutrients should be added to your brew to make it 
        more successful. Without nutrients fermentation may be slower,
         or stop completely before it is done. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are many commercial yeast nutrients that can be used including 
        diammonium phosphate, Fermaid K, and Fermaid O. However, they are not 
        all as equally effective. For example, diammonium phosphate (DAP) can 
        add some weird flavors to your brew as well as stall fermentation and 
        certain DAP products contain a carcinogenic ingredient. Fermaid O is 
        probably the healthiest nutrient for yeast leading to a steadier fermentation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        An alternative to buying one of these yeast nutrients is just 
        to use dead bread yeast. Using 2 to 3 times as much dead bread 
        yeast as a commercial nutrient will be just as effective as 
        Fermaid O and much cheaper. To kill your bread yeast you can 
        either bake it or boil it for a few minutes at 140â„‰. Some brewers 
        prefer to stagger their nutrient additions by adding their nutrient 
        of choice in two or three portions over a span of a few days; 
        however it is just as effective and less complicated to 
        frontload your nutrients when you start your mead.
