            <p><h3>Sanitation</h3>
            Good sanitation practices are essential when making 
            mead to prevent your brew from getting infected. You must have 
            clean hands and sanitize all of your equipment correctly 
            whenever interacting with your brew. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Brewing sanitizers:</h4>
            <!--bullet points-->
            <ul>
                <li>Typically brewing sanitizers are no-rinse.</li>
                <li>They are just diluted in water and then the equipment should be
            dunked in the solution for at least thirty seconds.</li>
                <li>The equipment should be taken out of the solution and left to 
            dry for a bit but not rinsed off with water before use.</li>
                <li>If you are unable to get a brewing sanitizer you can boil your 
            quipment instead. Do not use vinegar or bleach because they can inhibit the yeast.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Safety Precautions:</h4>
            If you take the appropriate precautions and sanitize your equipment properly 
            it is highly unlikely that your brew will get infected. The environment 
            will not be very conducive to bacteria growth as there will not be any oxygen
            in your jug once fermentation begins; all the oxygen will be pushed out 
            through the airlock by the CO2 being produced. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Though unlikely it is important to be aware that it is 
            still possible for contamination to occur and keep the 
            following in mind in order to prevent it:
            <br>
            <br>
            Prevent your brew from being contaminated by making 
            sure any fruit you choose to use is processed in some way. 
            Fresh fruit should be cooked or frozen to kill any bacteria or microbes.
            <br>
            <br>
            If at any point you see any green, brown, or black particles 
            or growths floating around in your brew, throw it out
            and thoroughly clean your equipment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If there are white clumps they could be mold 
            but they could also just be yeast. To check 
            you can swirl the jar and see if the clumps 
            keep floating back up or if they settle. If 
            they keep coming back they could be mold so 
            it is important to be cautious at that point 
            but they could still just be yeast hulls so 
            you do not necessarily need to throw out your concoction yet. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It should be very obvious if your brew is not 
            safe to drink. It will smell rancid and will not look appealing to drink.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>How Do You Know if Fermentation is Occurring?</h3>
            Airlocks are used to let the CO2 created during fermentation escape while preventing anything unwanted from entering your brew. This allows your yeast to keep fermenting and more importantly prevents an explosion due to built up pressure. It is crucial to know when fermentation is fully complete to ensure you do not create bombs when bottling your brews.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Signs of fermentation:</h4>
            <!--bullet points-->
            The airlock should be active meaning bubbles of gas are escaping. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There should be lots of tiny bubbles floating to the top of your brew line. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If you notice that your brew has stopped fermenting much earlier than it was supposed to or after reaching an ABV significantly lower than the ABV tolerance of the yeast used, that means it has stalled.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Activating stalled brews:</h4> 
            You can stir your brew with a sanitized utensil to help activate the yeast again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You can add some yeast hulls (dead yeast) to your brew.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can ‘cold crash’ your brew by putting it in a much cooler location for a while until the temperature drops and then return it back to room temperature.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Using a hydrometer:</h4> 
            It is a good idea to document your ingredients and amounts to know approximately how much fermentable sugar you have at the beginning vs the end of fermentation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Specific gravity will tell you the total amount of fermentable sugars in your brew at a given time. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The way to take a specific gravity reading is by placing your hydrometer into a sample of your brew making sure to look at the specific gravity scale. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Finding ABV:</h4> 
            If you want to know the alcohol content of your mead you 
            should take a specific gravity reading at the beginning 
            before fermentation has started and a final reading when 
            fermentation is complete and then calculate the difference 
            between them and figure out the alcohol content with the 
            formula: ABV = (original gravity - final gravity) *131.25. 
            <br>
            <h4>How To Be Sure That Fermentation is Complete?</h4>
            Your hydrometer can be used to determine the alcohol content of your brew however this is optional if you do not care about the ABV of your brew. More importantly a hydrometer is necessary to be able to make sure fermentation is complete. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes yeast can exceed their alcohol tolerance so it is essential to check if fermentation is still occurring before bottling your mead. 
            <br>
            <br>
            To do this you should take two specific gravity readings a week apart to see if it has gone down. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If the gravity has changed this indicates that fermentation has occurred and might not be complete yet. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If it has not changed then fermentation is complete and your brew is ready to be bottled.

            <h3>Equipment Notes & Alternatives</h3>
            Your mixing utensil can be any longer spoon or utensil that you already have in your kitchen. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If you use a gallon jug with a narrow opening you will need a funnel as well to pour the ingredients into it.
            <br>
            <br>
            One Step & Star San are two common brewing sanitizers that can be used for cleaning your equipment before use.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you do not have a graduated cylinder you can use another clear container but it should be
             tall enough so your hydrometer can float in it to get a proper reading.
            <br>
            <br>
            Swing top and screw top bottles are the best for storing your meads for long periods of time. You can reuse old liquor bottles.

            <ul>
                <li>Packet of wine yeast</li>
                <li>1 tsp of Fermaid O or other yeast nutrient</li>
                <li>2 lbs of honey</li>
                <li>Filtered or boiled water (enough to fill the jug after the other ingredients have been added)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            This recipe can be customized by replacing some or all of the water with 
            juice or tea as well as by adding fruits and spices to taste. If you do 
            decide to use fruit, you can decrease the amount of honey used depending 
            on the amount and type of fruit you use because the fruit will also contain 
            fermentable sugars. This same principle applies to juices. Another thing 
            to be aware of when using juices is that often commercial juices contain 
            preservatives which will prevent fermentation so make sure to use a pure one. 
            <br>
            Bread yeast can also be used instead of wine yeast. 
            Instead of the yeast nutrient you can use dead bread 
            yeast which can be killed by baking or boiling it and 
            will serve the same purpose as a commercial yeast nutrient for a lower cost.
